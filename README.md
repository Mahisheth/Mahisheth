### 👋 Hi, I'm Mahi!

🎓 Undergraduate at Rutgers University studying Computer Science & Data Science<br/>
💭 Currently learning data analytics and cloud security<br/>

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me<br/>
I interned as a **Finance Data Analyst inter**n at Reveal Global Consulting, where I built data pipelines and dashboards to help stakeholders make informed decisions. Outside of class, I am actively involved in Rutgers' tech community through organizations like **Women in Computer Science** (WiCS), **Student Excellence Experiential learning, and Development in Data Science** (Seed2s), **Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Science** (USACS). I currently serve as a mentor for WiCS where I support women in tech through workshops and collaborative learning. I am preparing for my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and explroring cloud infrastructure, security and data analytics through side projects. I love to work in collaborative spaces whether it's hackathons, mentorship, or study groups, where I can learn, build, and grow alongside others. <br/>
